# WSCoreLaziness.framework 

From time to time I often find myself repeating certain small amounts of code which consists of a few lines. In the beginning it was ok, since I didn't mind it because of my lack of experience in Cocoa coding. Afterwards it got really annoying. Coming from Ruby (and Rails) background I remembered how awesome it was to have `ActiveSupport` around. It had so many helpful classes and functions that would improve developers' productivity and clear up the code!

WSCoreLaziness is a shot at making ActiveSupport for Cocoa frameworks. The idea is simple - create a collection of (as of this writing) Foundation framework categories that aim to shorten the amount of your typing and increase the amount of hitting `Esc` and `Tab` keys, provide familiar API and sensible defaults.

The framework is being developed using TDD using standard SenTestingKit.framework that comes together with Xcode.
